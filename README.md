# Angular Avatar Editors

[Storybook](https://andrewalderson.github.io/angular-avatar-editors/)

I am using this repository to explore different types of avatar editors I have encountered on the web. Most avatar/images editors I come across aren't concerned with accessiblity os this is the main focus of these projects.

#### Basic Avatar Editor - <mark>under development</mark>

A very basic avatar editor that uses a `img` element and a CSS Transform with a `DOMMatrix`. Supports Mouse, Touch and Keyboard interactions.

#### Microsoft Avatar Editor - <mark>under development</mark>

A replication of the current Avatar Editor used by Microsoft. It uses a `canvas` element to render the transformed image. Supports Mouse, Touch and Keyboard interactions. Also, supports external controls (sliders and buttons) to edit the image

#### Google Avatar Editor - <mark>under development</mark>

A replication of the current Avatar Editor used by Google. It uses an `img` element to render the transformed image. Supports Mouse, Touch and Keyboard interactions. Also supports an external button for rotation and a crop selection rectangle for scaling.
