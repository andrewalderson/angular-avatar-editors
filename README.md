# Angular Avatar Editors

[Storybook](https://andrewalderson.github.io/angular-avatar-editors/)

I am using this repository to explore different types of avatar editors I have encountered on the web. Most avatar/images editors I come across aren't concerned with accessiblity os this is the main focus of these projects.

#### Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the current and future goals for this repository.

- âœ… Complete
- ğŸŸ¡ In progress

## Basic Avatar Editor

A very basic avatar editor that uses a `img` element and a CSS Transform with a `DOMMatrix`. This implementation doesn't support rotation since there is not way to rotate the image with just the mouse. Rotation either requires a touch gesture of an external control.
